                    <h1>Drop Pinch-off Dynamics</h1>

                    <img src="images/drop.GIF" alt="drop" class="center" style="--center-width: 103%;">

                    <p>If you are ever out in the rain you may notice that water has this tendency of forming drops.
                        The water from the rain itself comes in drops, and so does the water that falls from the leaves
                        of a tree or the water that drips from the rooftop. This type of behavior, as a matter of fact,
                        is not limited to water and occurs with all kinds of fluids. But why? Why does a falling stream
                        of liquid break up into droplets and what does it look like?</p>
                    
                    <p>
                        The video above is an example of a pinch-off process for pure water falling through a circular nozzle.
                         I recorded this event with a high speed camera at 5899.71 fps, so everything in the video above took 
                         place within 50 ms. My first time seeing this I was completely delighted. It is incredible that a phenomenon
                         like this takes place around us all the time in our day to day life without being noticed. But what is the 
                         physics behind all that? Well, we have gravity trying to accelerate the fluid down, surface tension doing its 
                         best to keep the fluid together and minimize its surface area, and viscosity resisting any deformation to the fluid. 
                         And it is this tendency of surface tension to minimize the surface area of the fluid while conserving its 
                         volume that eventually leads to the pinch-off.
                    </p>

                    <img src="images/drop_fit1.png" alt="drop" class="center" style="--center-width: 100%; --center-max-width: 700px;">

                    <p>
                        In order to investigate the evolution of the drop with time, I used ImageJ to measure the minimum neck radius of 
                        the drop at different times from pinch-off. The result is shown in the log-log plot above. As it turns out, 
                        the minimum neck radius of the drop follows a power law with time. The fit is not perfect though, and that 
                        is because there is one power law in the earlier stage of the drop formation when surface tension dominates, 
                        and another power law in the later stages when viscosity dominates and the drop is about to pinch-off.
                    </p>

                    <img src="images/drop_rep.png" alt="drop" class="center" style="--center-width: 100%;">

                    <p>
                        What is most remarkable about the drop pinch-off dynamics is how repeatable it is. I compared the whole process 
                        frame-by-frame for six different drops and they look indistinguishable. The picture above shows one of my 
                        favorite patterns for six different drops of pure water. All of them were taken exactly 36 frames, or 6.1 ms, 
                        from the pinch-off.

                    <h1>Mass of the Neutron</h1>
                    <p>
                        The mass of charged fundamental particles, such as protons and electrons, can be measured by sending them 
                        through a magnetic field and determining the radius of curvature of their path (this technique is known as 
                        mass spectrometry). But what if you want to measure the mass of the neutron? They are neutral particles 
                        and so they don't experience a Lorentz force. If you were to send neutrons through a magnetic field their 
                        paths wouldn't be affected at all, so mass spectrometry doesn't work for them.
                        What do we do when things don't go our way? We smash them! In this case we smash neutrons and protons to 
                        produce deuteron: 
                        
                        \[ \text{n} + \text{p} \rightarrow \text{d} + \gamma \] 
                        
                        Deuteron is a bound nucleus with one proton, one neutron, and a net charge of +1. Its mass can therefore 
                        be obtained through mass spectrometry. The idea of this experiment is then to measure the energy of the 
                        photon in the reaction above to obtain the mass of the neutron by conservation of energy. Our detection 
                        system consisted of a single NaI+PMT connected to a pulse-height analyzer, and our source of neutrons 
                        was a neutron howitzer.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        By intelligently choosing what materials to shield the detector with, we were able to isolate the capture 
                        gamma peak, which we measured to be centered at \( E_\gamma = (2.11\pm 0.06)\ \text{MeV} \). From this 
                        result, we can use conservation of energy to obtain the rest mass of the neutron: \(m_n = (939.45 \pm 0.06)\ \text{MeV}\).

                    <h1>Exploring Active Galactic Nuclei Feedback with Survey Science</h1>
                    <p>
                        How does the AGN feedback effect change the shape of the total matter distribution in galaxies and 
                        galaxy clusters? So far, this has been studied using hydrodynamical simulations. However, all the 
                        hydrodynamical simulations tend to disagree with each other and none of them agree well with data, 
                        so we want to investigate this directly using data.
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/agn.png" alt="drop" class="center" style="--center-width: 100%; --center-max-width: 700px;">
                    <p>
                        To understand the impact of this AGN feedback effect, we must first understand where they are located. 
                        One question we have is how often do we find AGNs in a cluster or 
                        galaxy sample that we are interested in? The problem here is that galaxy cluster catalogs are usually 
                        generated avoiding the locations of AGNs so we need to look at optical galaxy samples. The goal is 
                        then to determine what the probability is in finding AGNs in such environments.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        One of the ways I analyzed the distribution of AGNs in relation to optical clusters was through angular 
                        correlation functions, which is a convenient method to quantify the clustering of points in the sky.
                        Positive values of the correlation function indicate clustering of points at that scale, and negative 
                        values indicate avoidance. The figure above shows the angular correlation function between redMaPPer 
                        galaxy clusters and AT20G AGNs. The variance was estimated using jackknife resampling.
